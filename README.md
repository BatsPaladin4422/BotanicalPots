Have you ever felt bored whilst waiting for a plant to grow? Or maybe you're simply not satisfied with how hard it is to automate the process of farming **flowers**, **fungi**, and most importantly - **trees**?. **Botanical Pots** is a quick, yet powerful solution to both of these problems!

> ⚙️ **Getting Started** </p>
> To get your hands on a **botanical pot**, simply click a regular one with a **bone meal**. You can then dye the **ornament** and even **upgrade** the pot, but **more on this later**.

Botanical Pots allow you to grow trees (and, **if upgraded**, other plants) in a much more _reliable_ way since there's no need to chop down the grown result anymore - such a toolbag! In fact, they even allow you to automate the process **further**.

> 👀 **Psst...** </p>
> Every plant has a small chance of **5%** of dropping a **treat**, this ranges from **apples** to **honeycombs**, just **stay patient**.

As said, you're able to fully automate the process of collecting wood. Doing so is even simpler than it might sound. As long as there is **a container below**, all the produced resources will be automatically put there. This even works on modded blocks - it's **as easy as it gets**!

Refilling the pot isn't hard either, a simple **hopper** on top will do the trick!

> 💡 **Good-To-Know** </p>
> The speed rate of botanical pots is directly influenced by the `randomTickSpeed` gamerule. This also means that setting it to 0 completely disables all pots.

## <center>Upgrading 🪽</center>

As previously mentioned, pots can be **upgraded** to gain different buffs. To upgrade a pot, use an upgrade on it. 

There are two main categories of upgrades, **common** and **rare** ones. Just as always, the **common** ones are easier to get, but provide arguably fewer buffs than **rare** ones.

There's no need to list all upgrades in a row here, just remember that **whenever you obtain a brick**, all recipes will be added to your recipe book. Just follow it to obtain the upgrade you want!

> 💡 **Good-To-Know** </p>
> You can grow other plants in pots, but under one single condition: the pot must have the **rich soil** upgrade applied! It's even shown in the image above.
